Please note this is not a finished project and it still has a lot of refining and cleaning up as well as expanding to be done. there is a live feedback system thats in the process of being integrated into the Squiggle Interpreter as well as a Report generator that was in the early build. any ideas on what else to add are always welcome and I hope this is of use to those who are interested in this sort of thing.  

# The Squiggle Interpreter

*The Squiggle Interpreter* is an open-source EEG/qEEG analysis platform designed to bridge clinical, research, and industry standards. Developed by **EL Chaderino/VocalARR**, this tool is intended to empower users by providing a transparent, customizable, and extensible solution for advanced EEG data processing. Unlike black-box systems, The Squiggle Interpreter exposes its inner workings‚Äîallowing users to verify, modify, and expand its capabilities.

## Overview

The Squiggle Interpreter is built to analyze EEG data in EDF format and generate a wide array of visual and quantitative outputs. It integrates advanced signal processing techniques with state-of-the-art source localization, time-frequency analysis, and clinical metrics computation. By providing a modular design and detailed logging, the tool serves as a transparent "glass-box" platform that can be audited, enhanced, and integrated with other tools.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **EEG Data Grouping and Preprocessing**  
  Scans directories for EDF files and automatically groups by subject and condition (EO/EC). Applies standard montages and referencing. Optional CSD support for enhanced surface mapping.

- **Band Power Analysis**  
  Computes absolute and relative band power for Delta, Theta, Alpha, SMR, Beta, and High Beta bands.

- **Topographic Mapping**  
  Creates global topomaps (absolute and relative) for each frequency band. Dark-mode styled for publication-quality output.

- **Waveform and ERP Visualization**  
  Generates global waveform grids and pseudo-ERP plots to show signal characteristics.

## Architecture and Modules

The Squiggle Interpreter is organized into several modules:

- **io_utils.py**  
  Contains utilities for scanning directories for EDF files, grouping them by subject, and loading the raw EEG data with standard preprocessing.

- **processing.py**  
  Implements advanced signal processing functions, including:
  - Band power calculation
  - Robust z-score mapping
  - Coherence computation
  - Time-frequency analysis
  - Source localization (inverse operator computation and source estimate application)

- **plotting.py**  
  Provides visualization routines for:
  - Topomaps (absolute & relative power)
  - Waveform grids
  - Coherence matrices
  - Time-frequency representations (TFR)
  - ICA component plots
  - Source localization images  
  All plots are optimized for dark mode.

- **clinical.py**  
  Computes clinical metrics on a per-channel basis and generates detailed plots for each site (PSD overlays, waveform overlays, and difference plots).

- **report.py**  
  Uses Jinja2 to build an interactive HTML report that integrates all visualizations and metrics into one comprehensive document.

- **main.py**  
  Serves as the main execution script, orchestrating the reading of EEG data, processing, visualization, and report generation. It also includes a live EEG display simulation for real-time feedback.

Each module is designed to be self-contained yet interconnected, following industry best practices for modularity, documentation, and testability.



## Clinical, Research, and Industry Standards

- **Clinical Standards**  
  The platform applies standard EEG montages (10-20 system), average reference projection, and standardized frequency bands. Computed metrics (e.g., Theta/Beta ratio, robust z-scores) align with widely accepted clinical practices.

- **Research Standards**  
  Advanced techniques such as source localization (LORETA variants), time-frequency analysis using Morlet wavelets, and coherence analysis are implemented based on current academic literature. This transparency ensures that researchers can validate and extend the methodologies.

- **Industry Standards**  
  Designed for scalability and reproducibility, the tool leverages robust libraries like MNE-Python and adheres to open-source principles. Its modular design facilitates integration into larger workflows and commercial pipelines if needed.
